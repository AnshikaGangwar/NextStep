This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This is the tool to manage notes/highlights into various groups. In order to run the code follow the below given steps. Basically the features are-
1) Add new highlight using Add New Highlight button
2) Add new group using Add New Group button
3) Drag the created highlights in order to reorder or move them to new group.
4) Can delete specific highlight by clicking on Delete button given in card of each highlight.

Note: Some dummy highlights are added to the screen in order to show the UI. Add your own highlights so that you can see features like ordering, dragging and deleting.
Also can add database so that the highlights added are not lost when page is refreshed.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
